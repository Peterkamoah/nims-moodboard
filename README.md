NIMS Website Mood Board

This is a mood board I created for the NIMS website project.

It shows the style and design for the website to have. I used colors, fonts, images, and layout ideas that look clean, professional, and academic.

Whatâ€™s included:
- A mood board image (JPG)
- Colors inspired by Morehouse College (like maroon and gray)
- Simple layout ideas (hero image, about section, programs, etc.)

This mood board is heavily inspired by the [Morehouse College website](https://morehouse.edu)

Thanks for checking it out!
